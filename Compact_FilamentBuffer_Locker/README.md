# Compact Filament Buffer Locker

This mod adds a part to the ["compact filament buffer"](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5525277) to include a locked to prevent the filament wheels from lifting out of their track. 

It also fixes the issue of the wheels being pushed outward and the filament getting jammed in the wheel.

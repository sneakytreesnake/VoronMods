# Ge5C Z Pressfit

This mod is intended as an alternative to [Hartk's Ge5C Z Joint mod.](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/hartk1213/Voron2.4_GE5C)

I personally found the Ge5C bearing to "float", which isn't really ideal for a bearing intended to constrain the gantry's movement.

I opted to instead press fit the bearing into the top of the Z joint.
